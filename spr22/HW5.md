# Homework 5: Revision of Literature Review

**Due:** Thursday, March 17, 2022 by 11:59pm 
 
## Assignment

Take the feedback I've provided on HW4 and revise your literature review.

In Overleaf, make a copy of your HW4 project and apply your revisions in the new HW5 project. Do not edit or "Resolve" the comments in your HW4 project. *Turn on sharing and share the project with mweigle@odu.edu*

There will be no separate GitHub repo for this assignment.  You will be adding content to your spr22-hw4 GitHub repo.

In your spr22-hw4 repo, create a new Markdown document named `HW5-report.md` that contains the following information:

* name, class, date, HW #, etc.
* list/description of the changes you made -- typos and minor edits can be grouped together in a single general entry, but if you make more substantive changes, describe what you did
* if you are using Overleaf (recommended), include the links to both your original HW4 Overleaf project and your revised HW5 Overleaf project

If you use something other than Overleaf, you must *also* include the following files in your GitHub repo:

* `litreview-lastname.tex` - *replace `lastname` with your last name*
* `litreview-lastname.pdf`
* `litreview-lastname.bib` - BiBTeX file

**Note:** These files should have the same name as the files you submitted for HW4.  GitHub will highlight the changes made in the different versions of the files with the same name.

## Submission

Submit the URL of your GitHub repo in Blackboard:

* Click on HW5 under Assignments
* Under "Assignment Submission", click the "Write Submission" button.
* Copy/paste the URL of your GitHub repo into the edit box
  * should be something like ht<span>tps://</span>github.com/odu-cs800-research/spr22-hw4-*username*/
* Make sure to "Submit" your assignment.

If you use Overleaf, I will provide feedback in Comments in Overleaf.  Otherwise, I will provide comments on your .tex file in the GitHub repo using the "Feedback" pull request.
