# Homework: Dissertation Presentation

**There are several milestone due dates, described below**

*Acknowledgement: This assignment was inspired by the ["Dissertationpalooza!"](https://phonedude.github.io/cs891-f17/dissertationpalooza.html) from [CS 891 at ODU](https://phonedude.github.io/cs891-f17/).*

The main goals of this assignment are to:

* familiarize you with prior work in your research area
* provide an example of successful PhD dissertations
* give you practice at presenting others' research

## Assignment

Work with your advisor to select an appropriate dissertation. (*This is not a suggestion.  You must talk with your advisor about your dissertation choice.*) Preferably, this should be one from your research group at ODU ([ODU-CS theses and dissertations](https://digitalcommons.odu.edu/computerscience_etds/)). If your advisor is a new faculty member, this could potentially be their dissertation or one from a comparable research group.

You will read the dissertation and prepare and deliver a 20-minute presentation. The original authors had approximately an hour to present their research, you will have much less time (with questions and discussion, the entire presentation should fit into a 25-minute slot). Since you have less than half of the original time, you will need to focus on the research questions, technical highlights, results/evaluation, and the contributions of the dissertation; there will not be time to present the work in its entirety.

Feel free to use figures and tables from the dissertation (be sure to mark their figure/table number from the original work), but the slides and text must be your own work – not a simplified version of the original slides. You’re presenting your perspective on their work – not just a slimmed down version of the original presentation. To reiterate, you are not defending the work, you aren't pretending to be the author (so don't say things like "In our work, we did ..."), but you are summarizing the work that the author did.

In developing your presentation, make sure that you review the [Academic Communication - presenting slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bCCL7bw5j41e3se3oLH-qakLT0P0GKFhec5T8EZ9FXs/edit#slide=id.p1), to be discussed in class Feb 15-17.

I will review draft presentations slides and can meet with each student (either in person or via Zoom) to provide feedback that you should incorporate into your final presentation.

If you can attend class in person on one of the presentation days (scheduled for Apr 5-21), I would like you to present live. If you cannot attend, you will either have to present live via Zoom (preferred) or record yourself giving the presentation.

Although the presentations will be given over several class meetings, everyone has the same due date (Apr 5) for their final presentation materials. We will work on scheduling the presentation slots later in the semester.

After the submission deadline, I will download all presentations to the classroom computer.
