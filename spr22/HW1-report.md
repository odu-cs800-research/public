# HW1 - Course Setup and RCR

Your Name Here  
CS 800  
Due: Jan 18, 2022

## Git, GitHub

***Q1.** What is your GitHub username?*

## ODU-CS Linux

***Q2:** How can you contact the Computer Science help desk?*

***Q3:** What hostname should you use to connect to the ODU-CS systems?*

***Q4:** In what directory will your webpages reside?*

***Q5:** What is the URL of your new webpage?*

## Markdown

***Q6.** Replace the code in the fenced code block with another block of code. You can use some Python code, or you can insert code from a different language -- just change the language indicated so that syntax highlighting still works properly.*

```python
#!/usr/local/bin/python3
# testargs.py

import sys

print ("{} is the name of the script." . format(sys.argv[0]))
print ("There are {} arguments: {}" . format(len(sys.argv), str(sys.argv)))

for ind, arg in enumerate(sys.argv):
    print ("[{}]: {} {}".format(ind,arg,sys.argv[ind]))
```

***Q7.** Edit the table so that it matches the first 3 weeks of our class schedule, as given in our [syllabus](https://github.com/odu-cs800-research/public/blob/main/spr22/syllabus.md).*

This is a simple table.  

|Date|Topic|
|:---:|:---:|
|Sep 1, 3|Introduction, What's Vis and Why Do It?|
|Sep 8, 10|Data and Data Cleaning|

## LaTeX and Overleaf

***Q8.** What is the link to view your newly created project? (Under "Anyone with this link can view this project")*

## Responsible Conduct of Research

***Q9.** Include the image in your report in place of the "Growth of the Early Web" image. Make sure to change the description of the image in the report.*

The example figure below shows the growth in the number of websites between 1993 and 1996.  I've used HTML to insert this to show how images can be scaled.  Change the width value as needed so that your image is an appropriate size.

<img src="growth-early-web.png" width=400 />

***Q10.** Replace the references with three webpages that you've visited so far this semester related to this class. These should include both the title of the webpage/article and the URL.*
