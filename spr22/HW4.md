# Homework 4: Literature Review

**Due:** Tuesday, February 22, 2022 by 11:59pm

*Acknowledgement: This assignment was inspired by [Assign1](https://courses.cs.vt.edu/~cs5014/F15/Assign1.html) and [Assign9](https://courses.cs.vt.edu/~cs5014/F15/Assign9.html) from [CS 5014 at Virginia Tech](https://courses.cs.vt.edu/~cs5014/F15/index.php).*

## Assignment

Write a literature review of at least 5 papers in your research area.  Talk to your PhD advisor to get suggestions for papers to include. These papers may be the same as (or a subset of those) you used for HW3. 

Your lit review must contain the following sections:

* Introduction - one paragraph overview of the research area you are reviewing and the common problem/motivation/technique/dataset that the papers are addressing, including why these papers were selected for inclusion (i.e., they reflect the latest research, they are the foundational papers in the area, etc.)
* Summaries - one paragraph for each of the papers that summarizes the main ideas, reflecting your understanding of the paper
* Synthesis - a description of how the papers fit together and their relationship to the overall body of work in your topic, can be multiple paragraphs
* References - list of references included in the lit review, must be generated using BibTeX - you must cite the papers appropriately in the Summaries section to generate this reference list

The entire document must be written in your own words.  *Do not copy/paste or just paraphrase sections directly from any paper.*

I will provide feedback on this, and you will do a round of revisions in a later HW assignment.

## Formatting

Your document must be generated as a PDF using LaTeX.  I have provided an [Overleaf lit review template](https://www.overleaf.com/read/nydkrmgtxjyd) for your use. Create a new Overleaf project and copy the files, making sure to edit the places indicated.

Your document must be written using 12 pt Times New Roman font with 1-inch margins on all sides. Each page must be numbered with a heading that contains the assignment number and your last name.  The first line of all paragraphs must be indented, and there should be a 0.5em vertical space between each paragraph.  These settings are all included in the Overleaf template. 

The Introduction and Summaries sections should together be about two pages.  The Synthesis section should be one-half to a full page.  The overall literature review, not counting references, should be as close as possible to exactly three pages long, but no shorter than two and a half pages. You absolutely must not go into a fourth page (though, references may go onto page four).

## Additional Document

In addition to your literature review document, you must create a Markdown document named `HW4-report.md` that contains the following information:
* name, class, date, HW #, etc.
* reference line and link to each paper in your lit review
* if you are using Overleaf (recommended), include the link to your Overleaf project -- *turn on sharing and share the project with mweigle@odu.edu*

## Submission

All submissions must include the following items in your GitHub repo:

* `HW4-report.md`
* PDFs of the papers in your lit review

If you use something other than Overleaf, you must *also* include the following files in your GitHub repo:

* `litreview-lastname.tex` - *replace `lastname` with your last name*
* `litreview-lastname.pdf`
* `litreview-lastname.bib` - BiBTeX file

Submit the URL of your GitHub repo in Blackboard:

* Click on HW4 under Assignments
* Under "Assignment Submission", click the "Write Submission" button.
* Copy/paste the URL of your GitHub repo into the edit box
  * should be something like ht<span>tps://</span>github.com/odu-cs800-research/spr22-hw4-*username*/
* Make sure to "Submit" your assignment.

If you use Overleaf, I will provide feedback in Comments in Overleaf.  Otherwise, I will provide comments on your .tex file in the GitHub repo using the "Feedback" pull request.
