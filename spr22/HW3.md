# Homework 3: Reading Papers Using Keshav's First Pass
 
**Due:** Thursday, February 3, 2022 by 11:59pm

## Assignment

Find 5 papers in your research area that are related to your interests.  Talk to your PhD advisor and get recommendations.  Perform [Keshav's 1st pass](http://blizzard.cs.uwaterloo.ca/keshav/home/Papers/data/07/paper-reading.pdf) on each paper and identify its problem, approach, and contributions.

Create a Markdown document named `HW3-report.md` (with your name, date, CS 800) that contains the following for each paper:
* reference line (as it might appear in a list of references)
* link to the paper PDF (or paper landing page if at ACM Digital Library or IEEE Xplore)
* appropriately edited BibTeX entry formatted as a [fenced code block](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks) (use ` ```bibtex ` for syntax highlighting)

You must include a marked-up PDF of each paper in your GitHub repo.  The markings can be done by hand and scanned in or made using Acrobat or another PDF markup tool.  The markings (e.g., highlights, boxes, text) should clearly identify the problem, approach, and contributions found in the sections you read.
